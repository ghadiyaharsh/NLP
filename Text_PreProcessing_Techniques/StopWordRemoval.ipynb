    "Stop words are frequently occurring, insignificant words such as \"the\", \"is\", \"in\", \"and\", etc., which do not carry much meaning and are often removed from text data to improve the performance of text analysis tasks.\n",

    "By eliminating stop words, we reduce noise and focus on the more meaningful words in the text, making downstream tasks like text classification, clustering, and information retrieval more efficient and effective."
